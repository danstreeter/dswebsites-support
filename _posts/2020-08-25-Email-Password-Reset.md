If you have forgotten your email account password, you can reset it via your hosting control panel.

Step-by-step guide
------------------

Changing passwords for any mailbox can be done through the your account control panel.

1.  Log in to your hosting account control panel at [https://cpanel.dswebsites.co.uk](https://cpanel.dswebsites.co.uk/login?r=%2F) and select 'Manage Hosting' for the account that you need to reset.
2.  Choose 'Email Accounts' under 'Email'.
3.  Simply locate your mailbox and enter a new password and click "Update". Your new password will have been successfully saved. 

Note: You will not be able to recover your old password for the mailbox. We do this to increase your security.
